# AstroRallye

The Astrorally is a project developed for the school library. With their help, new students at the school should get to know the library better. The PWA is therefore designed for sixth and ninth generation iPads used at our school. 15 groups of students can answer questions on 15 different iPads at the same time, in the end a common solution comes out to make the rally cooperative instead of competitive.


## Installation

Since the PWA is intended to be used in school lessons, it should not be immediately apparent that you are in a browser. Therefore, the app uses the standalone property of the Safari browser. To do this, however, the page must first be added to the home screen and opened from there.


## Design
The PWA is intended to be used primarily by 11-year-olds. To generate interest in a school activity, the rallye is set in context. The students are astronauts who need to gather information because the onboard computer has failed. To create the right mood, the design of the PWA is therefore based on space.
